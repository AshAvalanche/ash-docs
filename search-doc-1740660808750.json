Yet, at the time of writing, none of those are production-ready (according to their documentation). Relying on years of experience in DevOps best practices, the Ash team developed the Ansible Avalanche Collection. Using Ansible, the industry standard for IT automation, the collection allows developers to deploy and configure nodes, Subnets, and blockchains to their own infrastructure, whether on bare-metal machines or virtual machine instances from any cloud provider. There are multiple perks to using the Ansible Avalanche Collection, including: Reduce errors related to manual configurationsScale to hundreds of nodes seamlesslyUpdate or rollback the AvalancheGo version in a transparent fashionThe benefit of a production-ready configuration of AvalancheGo following the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard The Ansible Avalanche Collection is open-source and available on GitHub under the BSD-3 license. The Ash team is committed to open-source all the tools that will benefit Avalanche users and developers. The Avalanche Ansible Collection is part of our solution to reduce the technical cost related to deploying validator nodes 4, Subnets, and blockchains.

Extra development is required to reach an acceptable level of usability (don't tell us you like querying JSON-RPC endpoints with cURL 😬).The API layout is not optimal for all queries and sometimes requires multiple calls to get the desired information. The Ash CLI abstracts this complexity and provides a single command to get the information you need. Let's see how easy it is to list all the blockchains of the Vn3aX6hNRstj5VHHm63TCgPNaeGnRSqCYXQqemSqDd2TQH4qJ Subnet using Ash CLI vs cURL: Using cURLUsing the Ash CLI curl -s -X POST --data '{ &quot;jsonrpc&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;: &quot;platform.getBlockchains&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: {}, &quot;id&quot;: 1 }' -H 'content-type:application/json;' https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/P | jq '.result.blockchains[] | select(.subnetID == &quot;Vn3aX6hNRstj5VHHm63TCgPNaeGnRSqCYXQqemSqDd2TQH4qJ&quot;)'   Limitations of the Avalanche CLI developped by Ava Labs The Avalanche CLI only support using the avalanche-network-runner for local/private networks. We needed a way to interact with any Avalanche network.The Avalanche CLI outputs were not made to be parsed, which makes it impossible to use it in scripts, CI/CD pipelines or other automation tools.
