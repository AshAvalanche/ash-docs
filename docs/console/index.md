# Ash Console

## Overview

The Ash Console is the one-stop shop for **Appchain development and operation** on Avalanche. It allows you to manage your validators, create Subnets and monitor your network **on your own infrastructure** (AWS, GCP and Azure are supported during the public **beta**).

:::info
Most of the components powering the Ash Console are [**open-source**](https://github.com/AshAvalanche/).

## Features

### Validator management

Manage Avalanche validator nodes seamlessly with the Ash Console. Edit configuration keys, install, upgrade, or restart AvalancheGo in just a few clicks.

### Subnets management

Create Subnets, blockchains and manage their lifecycle with the Ash Console.

### Networks

Ash supports running Avalanche validator nodes in a private devnet network, on the Fuji testnet or on the mainnet (**not supported during the public beta**).

### Monitoring

Get a comprehensive view of your validators with our prebuilt dashboards presenting a complete suite of metrics (AvalancheGo metrics, machine metrics, Subnet centric metrics).

### Block explorer

Analyze blocks, transactions, addresses and more with your very own [Blockscout](https://www.blockscout.com/) instance to get full grasp of whatâ€™s going on in your Subnet.
