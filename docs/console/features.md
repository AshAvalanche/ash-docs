### Automatic upgrade

Ash will make sure your validators are always up to date with the latest release of AvalancheGo.

Launch a fully configurable [Faucet](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-faucet) plugged on your Subnet for easy testing and user on-boarding.

### Block explorer

Analyze blocks, transactions, addresses and more with your very own [Blockscout](https://www.blockscout.com/) instance to get full grasp of whatâ€™s going on in your Subnet.

### Load balanced RPC

Never worry about your Subnet availability again with our automatic load balancer. Choose the nodes that should serve the request and your Subnet RPC is ready to go.
