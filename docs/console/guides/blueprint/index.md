# One-Command Devnet (Local Network)

:::caution
The Ash Console is currently in alpha and **not production-ready**. It is under active development and subject to breaking changes.
:::

Similarly to the [Avalanche Devnet guide](/docs/console/guides/local-network/), this guide will walk you through setting up **a 5-node Avalanche devnet** ([local network](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/configure/avalanchego-config-flags#network-id)) with the Ash Console, but this time with **a single command**!

We will leverage the [blueprint](/docs/console/reference/blueprints) feature of the Ash CLI.

:::tip
Devnets allow you to **develop your Subnet out of sight** in an environment where you have full control!
:::

:::info
Devnets use the `local` network setup with hardcoded validator nodes and airdrop address.
