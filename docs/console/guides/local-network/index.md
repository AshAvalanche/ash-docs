# Avalanche Devnet (Local Network)

:::caution
**UPDATE**: The Ash Console open beta has ended. Looking to launch your Avalanche L1? See our latest [Ash Managed L1s offer announcement](https://ashavax.hashnode.dev/announcing-ash-managed-l1s-and-avalanche-builder-credits)!
:::

This guide will walk you through setting up **a 5-node Avalanche devnet** ([local network](https://docs.avax.network/api-reference/avalanche-go-configs-flags#network-id)) with the Ash Console.

:::tip
Devnets allow you to **develop your Subnet out of sight** in an environment where you have full control!
:::

:::info
Devnets use the `local` network setup with hardcoded validator nodes and airdrop address.
