# Avalanche Devnet (Local Network)

:::caution
The Ash Console is currently in alpha and **not production-ready**. It is under active development and subject to breaking changes.
:::

This guide will walk you through setting up a 5-node Avalanche devnet ([local network](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/configure/avalanchego-config-flags#network-id)) with the Ash Console.

Devnets allow you to develop your Subnet out of sight in an environment where you have full control!

:::info
Devnets use the `local` network setup with hardcoded validator nodes and airdrop address.
