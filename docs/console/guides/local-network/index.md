# Avalanche Devnet (Local Network)

:::caution
The Ash Console is currently in beta and **not production-ready**. It is under active development and subject to breaking changes.
:::

This guide will walk you through setting up **a 5-node Avalanche devnet** ([local network](https://docs.avax.network/api-reference/avalanche-go-configs-flags#network-id)) with the Ash Console.

:::tip
Devnets allow you to **develop your Subnet out of sight** in an environment where you have full control!
:::

:::info
Devnets use the `local` network setup with hardcoded validator nodes and airdrop address.
