# Staking Wizard

:::caution
The Ash Console is currently in beta and **not production-ready**. It is under active development and subject to breaking changes.
:::

The **Ash Console** provides users with a handy staking wizard to help them turn their node into a **Primary Network validator** and start earning staking rewards by using one of the methods below:
- Native staking with [**Core.app**](https://core.app/)
- Pay-as-you-Go (PAYG) with [**BENQI ignite**](https://ignite.benqi.fi/)
- Run a Minipool with [**GoGoPool**](https://app.gogopool.com/)

To access the Staking wizard, navigate to one of your Avalanche Node [resource](/docs/console/glossary#resource) and clik on the "Staking" button:
