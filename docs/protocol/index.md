# The Ash Protocol

Ash is a **decentralized VaaS** (Validator as a Service) protocol for [Avalanche](https://avax.network).

Ash lowers the **financial and technical entry costs** to the [Subnets ecosystem](https://docs.avax.network/subnets) for all the participants:

- **Subnet owners** that can benefit from Ash's decentralized network of node operators
- **Retail users** that can get involved whatever their capital or technical skills
- **Node operators** that can rely on enterprise-grade tooling and leverage Ash's capital

The protocol is **open and transparent**: governance and operations are tracked on-chain.

Thanks to Ash, Avalanche Subnets can reach a higher degree of decentralization.

Ash is taking a smooth path towards decentralization. See the [protocol roadmap](./roadmap) for more information.
