# Ash for Subnet Owners - Overview

:::tip
**Subnet owner:** An organization, whether public or private, that uses a dedicated Avalanche Subnet. The Subnet hosts one or more blockchains, serving as a backend for the business logic.
:::

Ash offers 2 validation services to Subnet owners:

- Validation renting
- Spontaneous validation by the protocol

## Validation renting

Subnet owners can **rent validation** from Ash nodes for a **fraction of the price** needed to bootstrap a validator.

Instead of operating validator nodes themselves, Subnet owners **benefit from the expertise of the Ash team** (and Ash network of node operators in [V3](../roadmap)).

The rent is **paid every month** in AVAX, native tokens, or a combination of both. The protocol guarantees that Subnets are validated by a **robust, up-to-date set of nodes**.

Subnet owners are freed from the burden of running their own infrastructure and can instead focus on building their projects core.

## Spontaneous validation

In Ash [V2](../roadmap), liquid stakers will gain the ability to participate in the [protocol's governance](../governance/overview). The most important component of the governance is **the allocation of the protocol's validating power** to Subnets.

Node operator **rewards are redistributed to liquid-stakers**. By offering attractive rewards, a Subnet will **spontaneously get more decentralized** because it will appeal more users.
