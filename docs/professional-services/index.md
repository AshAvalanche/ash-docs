# Professional Services

## Our team expertise

Why you can trust our team:

### Distributed systems architecture

[Gauthier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauthier-leonard/) and [Léo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-schoukroun/), our technical founders, have **years of experience operating France's biggest data clusters** based on open-source technologies.  
They have deep knowledge of distributed systems architecture challenges and are experts in setting up highly available and scalable infrastructures.

### Avalanche knowledge

#### Open-source contributions

Our team maintains multiple [open-source tools](/docs/toolkit/) tailored for Avalanche and is actively contributing to other projects in the Avalanche ecosystem.

See examples of the team contributions:

- [Ava Labs repositories](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+involves%3ANuttymoon+involves%3Aleopaul36+archived%3Afalse+org%3Aava-labs+)

#### Node operating

Ash is **operating multiple Avalanche nodes** (on the mainnet and Fuji testnet), and taking part in decentralized RPC networks such as [Lava](https://lavanet.xyz).

### Education

[Gauthier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauthier-leonard/) has been a **distributed systems teacher** at some of the top French engineering schools ([CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), [ECE Paris](https://www.ece.fr/), [DSTI](https://www.datasciencetech.institute/fr/)) for more than 3 years.

## How we can help you

Our team can offer you the following services:

### Avalanche nodes setup and maintenance

Ash [open-source tools](/docs/toolkit/) and premium [Console](/docs/console/) plans can significantly reduce the setup and maintenance cost of your Avalanche nodes.

Our team can help you with the **initial setup** and provide you with a maintenance plan **tailored to your needs**.

### Additional features for the Ash tools

As the maintainers of the Ash [open-source tools](/docs/toolkit/) and [Console](/docs/console/), we can **develop additional features** for any need that is not already covered. This could be:

- Better support for your cloud provider
- Support for a new blockchain runtime (VM)
- Integration with your monitoring system
- Etc.

### Subnet (AppChain) design and development

Avalanche [Subnets](https://docs.avax.network/learn/avalanche/subnets-overview) allow any project to create **its dedicated blockchain** (or "AppChain") with their own set of rules and validators. Subnets can run **custom software** while benefiting from the **Avalanche consensus layer**.

Our team can help you **take the best decisions** regarding your Subnet design and follow you through the development process, **from devnet to mainnet**.

### Private blockchain network design and setup

The flexibility of Avalanche makes it the perfect tool to set up **private blockchain networks** with your partners. Each use case can be run on its own Subnet, with its own set of rules and runtime.

Our team can help you **design and setup** your private blockchain network, and **train your team** to operate it.

### Training and education

We can organize **training sessions** for your team to get them up to speed with Avalanche and its ecosystem.
